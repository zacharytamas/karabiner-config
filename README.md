# karabiner-config

This repository contains my Karabiner-Elements configuration, described using the `karabiner.ts` DSL/utility. It is pretty personal but possibly inspiring.

Note that running this will overwrite the `Default` profile in Karabiner-Elements. If you have a profile you want to keep, you should back it up first.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run (once):

```bash
bun run build
```

To run and watch for changes:

```bash
bun run watch
```
